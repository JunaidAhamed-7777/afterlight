# Omen acceptance log

Only actual execution reported by the designated Omen tester belongs here.
Source compilation and cloud review are not acceptance tests. No benchmark or
held-out dataset has yet been evaluated.

## 2026-11-02, first local checks (reported 21:28 UTC)

Environment: OMEN-16, Windows 10.0.26300, PowerShell 7.6.5, Python 3.12.15 venv,
Node 26.8.1/npm 12.2.1. Earlier headed Chrome 156 WebGL2 capability/readback check
passed with no GL error; this does **not** establish product rendering performance.

- Across source checkpoints `4068e3f` and `06ae7b1`, the tester reported 25 requested
  unit tests passing. This is not a pass for later source revisions or all flows.
- Actual HTTP adversarial checks at `4068e3f` found an incomplete two-field replay
  accepted as HTTP200, and nonfinite JSON causing an uncaught response failure.
  Source fixes were published in `7ea95f4` (nonfinite JSON) and `a3f9106` (canonical
  full replay validation). Local regression recheck is pending.
- Both fixture and full-city netconvert commands at `06ae7b1` failed because the
  executable was not discovered. XML inputs exist; **no SUMO network or real
  traffic rollout passed**. Packaged executable discovery is being corrected.
- Synthetic edge probes found finite inputs could overflow objective/recovery
  outputs and identical demand hashes could be split under different group IDs.
  Defensive fixes and regressions are in progress. No real dataset was evaluated.

Raw local logs remain with the tester. This narrative is a scoped summary, not a
replacement for exact command logs, generated evidence or future reruns.
